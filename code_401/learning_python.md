### Learning Python

##### In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

- Mental strain and emotional struggles are two main challenges faced. Two strategies that can be used to overcome these are leveraging community support and maintaining a growth mindset. Community support through friends, family, peers, instructors, etc. can help break through any blocks or exhaustion that is experienced. Maintaining a growth mindset will help to mitigate the temporary discomfort that can come with learning something entirely new.

##### Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

- Types such as strings and ints are immutable. The assignment can be rebound to a new value, but the original value assignment cannot be directly modified
- Types such as lists or sets can be mutated, or rebound completely. So an item in a list can be updated to a new value without creating an entirely new list, or the variable assignment can be rebound to an entirely new list
