### Keys to Developing a Growth Mindset

- Setting goals that push your boundaries through deliberate practice will improve your skills more than just regular programming alone
- Deliberate practice involves constant feedback, repeated challenges, and mental exhaustion
- You must set your own challenging goals to learn and grow
- Seek challenges that push you outside your comfort zone to learn something new and not just revisiting something you already know
- Using "Not Yet" instead of "failure" encourages a growth mindset and a path to improvement
- Celebrating the process, effort, and progress, rather than natural ability, promotes hardiness and resilience
- Grit (passion and perseverance for long-term goals) is a significant predictor of success in challenging contexts
- A growth mindset says that the ability to learn is not fixed but can change with effort
- Success should be defined personally and made truly our own, not imposed by society or external influences
