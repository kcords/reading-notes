Modules will be important to help with breaking Node.js applications into smaller chunks to maintain readability and simplify troubleshooting as complexity increases.

### Node JS - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?
   * A `js` file that contains code to be used in another file
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
   * Imports the export located at the directory specified in the provided string argument
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
   * In the importing file:
     `const varName = require('./file_name')`
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
   * In the exporting file:
     `module.exports = variableNameOrValue`
