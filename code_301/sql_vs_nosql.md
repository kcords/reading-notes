### SQL vs NoSQL

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:


   | SQL                                             | NoSQL                                                                             |
   | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Relational Databases (RDBMS)                    | Non-relational / distributed database                                             |
   | Table based: defined columns and records (rows) | Document based: key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores            |
   | Predefined schema                               | Dynamic schema for unstructured data                                              |
   | Vertically scalable                             | Horizontally scalable                                                             |
   | Uses SQL (structured query language)            | Uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) (syntax varies from database to database) |
2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

   * High transaction and/or complex query intensive environment
3. Give a real world example.

   * An e-commerce platform's product catalog including information about products, such as their names, categories, prices, and inventory levels
4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

   * Hierarchical data storage and large data sets
5. Give a real world example.

   * A social media platform's user-generated content including posts, comments, likes, and shares
6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

   * NoSQL
7. Which type of database is best for scalability?

   * SQL
8. What does SQL stand for?

   * Structured Query Language
9. What is a relational database?

   * A structured way to store and manage data in tables
10. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

    * Tables
11. What is a ‘schema’?

    * A blueprint or definition of how data is organized and stored within the database
12. What is a NoSQL database?

    * A flexible type of database good for handling large / diverse data that doesn't use traditional tables
13. How does it work?

    * By storing data in ways that suit different types of information
14. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

    * A collection (like tables) of documents (like records) which are JSON-like objects that represent a piece of data that don't have to follow the same schema
15. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    * NoSQL/MongoDB
    * The ability to add or exclude data in a specific document makes it more flexible and less rigid than a relational DB whose tables have strict structures and requirements
16. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    * Duplicated data
