### CRUD Basics

1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
   - `PUT`
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter
   - `UPDATE` and `DELETE` (and sometimes `GET`)

### REST and CRUD

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
    | CRUD | REST |
    | --- | --- |
    | CREATE | POST |
    | READ | GET |
    | UPDATE | PUT/PATCH |
    | DELETE | DELETE |

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
   1. Determine what resources will need to be accessed
   2. Design/model routes and methods needed for external API access
   3. Set up DB schema, connections, and queries
   4. Implement route handlers to connect each route to the corresponding resource
   5. Test the API using a tool such as Thunder Client or Postman
