### Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
   * A way of writing code that treats computations as mathematical functions, focusing on using pure functions and immutable data, meaning functions don't have side effects and data doesn't change after creation.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   * A function that always produces the same output for the same input and does not have any side effects like modifying variables outside its scope or interacting with the external world.
   * We can ensure that it doesn't modify any external state and always produces the same result for the same input.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
   * Predictability, reusability, easier to understand, and easier to test.
4. What is immutability?
   * Data that once created, its state remains constant and cannot be changed. Any operation appearing to modify it actually creates a new copy with the intended changes.
5. What is Referential transparency?
   * The idea that a function that is given the same input, will always produce the same output and if replaced with its corresponding output would not affect the program's behavior.
